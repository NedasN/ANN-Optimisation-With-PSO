# Particle Swarm Optimisitation Of A Neural Network
This project was made to explore the effectivenes of using PSO to find the optimal weights for a neural network, instead of the more common stochastic gradienty descent.
The code was written from scratch to ensure a good understanding of how PSO and neural networks work as well as how to encode neural networks into particles of a swarm.
For indepth explanaition of the code please read the report.
